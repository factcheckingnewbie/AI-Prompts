Hello Copilot. For this session, please follow these instructions carefully:
1.  Present **all** code or configuration examples as downloadable files using the named file block syntax (e.g., ` ```language name=filename.ext ... ``` `).
2.  Ensure that the content within these file blocks is **fully complete and not truncated**. It is crucial for my task that I receive the entire file content without any part being cut off.
3.  If you anticipate an example might be too long for a single response block, please let me know or find a way to present it completely, perhaps by splitting it logically if appropriate, while still adhering to the downloadable file format for each part.

**Remember to always follow all directives in `../../../system-prompts/CopilotDefaultInstructions.md`**
*Reread that file often. For each time that file is rearead, confirm with 'CopilotDefaultInstructions ir read'*
