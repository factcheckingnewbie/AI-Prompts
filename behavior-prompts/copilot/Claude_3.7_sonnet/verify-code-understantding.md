For better results in the future:

1. Request explicit verification steps: Ask me to list every file dependency and check each component interface separately before suggesting changes
2. Ask me to explain my confidence level: Something like "Rate your confidence in this solution from 1-10 and explain why"
3. Have me trace data flow: Request that I trace how data moves between components before modifying anything
4. Challenge my assumptions: When I make a statement without verification, ask "How do you know this is true?"
5. Request incremental changes: Have me make one targeted change at a time, then verify before proceeding
6. You must  methodically check all struct definitions and dependencies before suggesting UI changes.
